# Knowledge Showdown

Welcome to the Knowledge Showdown project! The project represents a collaborative effort between Boris Paunovic, who primarily focused on the backend, and myself, who led the development of the frontend.

Although we each had our respective roles, this project was a shared learning experience where we actively collaborated on all aspects of development. From brainstorming the database structure and designing the user interface to implementing functionality and debugging issues, we engaged in peer programming to refine our ideas and ensure a cohesive end product.

The Knowledge Showdown project showcases not only our technical skills but also our ability to work effectively as a team, learn from one another, and create a functional and engaging application.

We hope you enjoy exploring our project as much as we enjoyed building it!
